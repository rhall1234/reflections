What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a repository.  This is where you are going to keep all the files that you want to track and commit together.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Working directory is the folder you are in.
Repository is the collection of files that you want to/have committed
Staging area is the files that you are about to commit.
