When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are using more than one computer, or collaborating, or as a back-up of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you don't want to share your work with other people as it's not ready.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branch - when you want to try out a new feature
Clone - exact copy of repository.
Fork - clone of someone else's repository where you are going to make new features.  You need to make a clone in order to fork

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
If you want to work offline, then you have the most up to date copy of the remote.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
You would have to use something like Google Docs or email files around.  You wouldn't have to learn a new set of commands, but you would end up very confused about what the latest version was.  It seems worth investing in learning Git/Github to take advantage of it's great version control.
