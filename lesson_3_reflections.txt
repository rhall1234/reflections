When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
If you are using more than one computer, or collaborating, or as a back-up of your work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Sometimes you don't want to share your work with other people as it's not ready.
